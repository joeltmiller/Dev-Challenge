# Gravie Software Engineer Challenge    

### Time Box
6-8 Hours

## Synopsis

For this challenge you will implement the Giant Bomb API to create an application that will allow a user to select games and "rent" them. Take a look at how Giant Bomb displays games here to see the general look and feel we'd like to see. Your view should display the game thumbnail and title, and the rest is up to you. You can use any language and or framework you'd like.
